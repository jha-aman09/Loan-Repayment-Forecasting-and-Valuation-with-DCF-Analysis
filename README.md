# 📊 Loan Repayment Forecasting and Valuation with DCF Analysis

This repository contains the code to forecast loan repayments and evaluate the portfolio's value using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis. The project compares the calculated portfolio value with a client’s estimate to assess the accuracy of the forecast.

## 📂 Project Files

- **Data.csv**: Contains the historical data used for repayment forecasts.
- **portfolio_evaluation.py**: Python script that performs loan repayment forecasting, portfolio valuation, and compares the calculated portfolio value to the client's estimate.

## 🚀 Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jha-aman09/Loan-Repayment-Forecasting-and-Valuation-with-DCF-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   You can install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   After downloading the files, run the following command to execute the loan portfolio evaluation:
   ```bash
   python portfolio_evaluation.py
   ```

4. **Google Colab Link:**

## 📝 Description

This project uses a **rule-based approach** to forecast repayments for loan portfolios based on historical data. It calculates the discounted cash flows of future repayments and compares them against the client's estimated portfolio value. The model helps in **predicting the future portfolio value** and **assessing repayment patterns**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)
- CSV Data Handling
